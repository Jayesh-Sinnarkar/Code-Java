2. Create a menu driven application "TaskManager" to manage your day-to-day tasks. 

You can create a class Task with fields like taskId, taskName, description, taskDate, status, active. 
taskId should be unique and generated automatically.
status should be either PENDING, IN PROGRESS or COMPLETED.
active should be either true or false. Deleted task will have active=false 
Newly added task should have default status as PENDING and active=true
