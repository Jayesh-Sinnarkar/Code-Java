 Create multi threaded java application --- having 3 threads
main , even , odd ,averager

Create EvenPrinterTask , OddPrinterTask ,Average calculator task

Accept from user (in main thread)-- start & end values.
Pass these values from main to child threads.

Even no printer thread  should print even nos within range, with small delay (sleep=200ms)
Odd no printer thread should print odd nos within range , with small delay (sleep=250ms)
Averager thread should compute the average of all the numbers in the range n display it.


Ensure no orphans.

Solve above using extends Threads first & then using  implements Runnable scenario.
(You can try business logic of threads in imperative style manner n later functional style)
